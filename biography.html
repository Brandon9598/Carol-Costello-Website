              <p><span class="name">Carol Costello</span> was born in Birkenhead, England and lived there until she was nine years old and then  moved to Niceville, Florida.  She spent five years in Laon, France and had the opportunity to visit many of the wonderful art museums in Paris.  This is where her love of art  began.<br/><br/>
               She received a Bachelor of Science Degree in Medical Technology from the University of Nebraska, and worked as a medical technologist in several hospitals.  She put her technical training to use by working for the United States Air Force as the F-15 Oxygen System/ECS Program Manager.  She now lives in Perry, Georgia and pursues her love of art.<br/><br/>
               She received her art training by studying the figure and the portrait with Marc Chatov for four years. Among the artists she  has had the privilege of taking workshops from are Mau-Kun Yim, Gregory Packard, Carolyn Anderson, Lois Griffel, Jeffrey Watts, Dan Gerhartz, Bart Lindstrom, Zhaoming Wu, Alice Williams, Ted Nuttall, William Schneider, and Nancy Franke.<br/><br/>
               Some of the artists she admires and have influenced her work are Fechin, Serov, Repin, Zorn, Bongart, and Sargent.  Mau-Kun Yim really inspired her to find the beauty in everything you paint.  Trying to capture the beauty of the light striking the form is what she strives for in her paintings.<br/><br/>
               She has been a finalist in the Hilton Head Art League International Competition.  She has won recognition at the Middle Georgia Fine Arts Society Competitions; and she has been a finalist in the Salon International Competition at the Greenhouse Gallery, Portrait Society of Atlanta and Scottsdale Artistâ€™s School Brightest and Best Competitions.
